# intercomparison
This GUI can be used for Roos chamber intercomparison. The GUI will automatically calculate TPC, reading average, std, fleid chamber NDW.. The average + std displayed on the GUI are not corrected for TPC. The code applies TPC correction to average nCs measured per energy, which were used to calculate field chamber NDW.
